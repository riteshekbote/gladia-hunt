# LEADS laguna (seed)
- 2026-08-07 SEED: no model output yet; pipeline starts on first run.
## 2026-08-07 18:29:33 UTC [app] (model laguna)
[PRIO] api.gladia.io (CORS+wildcard + openapi.json), score 8.2 | attack:9, business:8, tech:7 (CORS misconfig), gate:9 (no auth on 404), cloud:8 (HSTS), freshness:10
[PRIO] api.gladia.io/openapi.json (full spec exposure), score 7.4 | attack:8, business:8, tech:7 (spec exposure), gate:10, cloud:6, freshness:8
[PRIO] app.gladia.io (return-to cookie JWT-shaped), score 6.8 | attack:7, business:6, tech:7 (JWT-ish cookie), gate:8, cloud:5, freshness:6
[PRIO] npm `gladia` 0.1.3 vs @gladiaio/sdk ownership conflict, score 5.1 | attack:6, business:5, tech:5, gate:9, cloud:4, freshness:7
[HYP] CORS wildcard reflects origin
class: MISCONFIG
asset: api.gladia.io
confidence: 75
reasoning: Known CORS `access-control-allow-origin: *` already confirmed; need to verify if it reflects a credentialed origin or sets Access-Control-Allow-Credentials. Seed explicitly asks "verify actual behavior."
evidence_needed: Origin header reflected in ACAO, or Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true with credentials
verify_steps: passive PROBE: `curl -H "Origin: https://evil.test" -D - -o /dev/null https://api.gladia.io/openapi.json`
impact: Attacker can read API spec + 404 details cross-origin; possible credentialed exfiltration if credentials allowed
testability: PASSIVE
[HYP] OpenAPI spec contains undocumented or shadow endpoints
class: MISCONFIG
asset: api.gladia.io/openapi.json
confidence: 55
reasoning: Spec is consumed by official SDK generator; seed says "check for undocumented/shadow endpoints." Spec lists 14 paths but may contain internal, deprecated, or test routes not documented externally.
evidence_needed: Path in spec that returns 200 with valid (or different) behavior vs. documented expectation, or path absent from public docs
verify_steps: passive PROBE: compare every path in spec against public docs; request a few obscure paths (e.g., /v1/history) to confirm reachability
impact: Unknown API surface, potential unauthenticated access to sensitive operations
testability: PASSIVE
[HYP] return-to cookie has weak/no signature validation
class: AUTH
asset: app.gladia.io/signin (redirect flow)
confidence: 45
reasoning: Cookie `return-to=eyJ1urwiOiIvIn0%3D` decodes to `{"url":"/"}` with no dot-separated signature segment (no alg). Seed asks to "check signature/alg handling."
evidence_needed: Server accepts crafted return-to value and redirects to attacker-controlled or unintended target
verify_steps: AUTH_HELPED: requires interactive signin flow test; not feasible passively without credential
impact: Open redirect / auth bypass in SSO flow
testability: AUTH_HELPED
[FINAL]
[NEXT] PROBE: `curl -H "Origin: https://evil.test" -D - -o /dev/null https://api.gladia.io/openapi.json` — check if `access-control-allow-origin` reflects `https://evil.test` and if `access-control-allow-credentials: true` is present.
[RISK] api.gladia.io: 72 reason: CORS wildcard exposure + full OpenAPI spec + x-api-key auth only | app.gladia.io: 55 reason: JWT-shaped unsigned cookie in redirect flow | sdk: 45 reason: npm ownership discrepancy (gladia vs @gladiaio/sdk)
## 2026-08-07 18:51:46 UTC [app] (model laguna)
[HYP] CORS wildcard enables cross-origin read of API data/spec (no credential support)
class: MISCONFIG
asset: api.gladia.io (all responses, incl. /openapi.json and /v1/models)
confidence: 65
reasoning: Passive OPTIONS/GET probes confirm static `access-control-allow-origin: *` with NO `access-control-allow-credentials`. Any origin can read the public OpenAPI spec, 404 bodies, exposed trace headers, and the unauthenticated /v1/models response cross-origin. Credentialled exfiltration is NOT enabled, but cross-origin readability broadens attacker reach.
evidence_needed: `access-control-allow-origin: *` in response headers; absence of `access-control-allow-credentials`
verify_steps: passive PROBE (already observed): `curl -H "Origin: https://evil.test" -D - -o /dev/null https://api.gladia.io/openapi.json`; `curl -H "Origin: https://evil.test" -D - -o /dev/null https://api.gladia.io/v1/models`
impact: Low-severity info disclosure — malicious site reads full API surface + model list + trace headers cross-origin; no credential theft since creds disallowed
testability: PASSIVE
[HYP] return-to cookie is unsigned base64url JSON enabling post-auth redirect manipulation
class: AUTH
asset: app.gladia.io /signin (return-to cookie + redirect_to form action)
confidence: 60
reasoning: Passive probe confirms root `/` sets `return-to=eyJ1cmwiOiIvIn0%3D` which decodes to plain JSON `{"url":"/"}` with 0 dots (no JWT signature). `/signin` reflects `redirect_to=https%3A%2F%2Fevil.example.com` into the OAuth form `action`. A crafted return-to/redirect_to could steer the Google OAuth post-auth redirect to an attacker-controlled host.
evidence_needed: Server honors attacker-supplied return-to/redirect_to and redirects post-authentication (HTTP 302 Location) to an external host
verify_steps: AUTH_HELPED: complete Google OAuth signin with `?redirect_to=https://evil.example.com` and observe the post-auth HTTP 302 Location; passive pre-check: `curl -sS "https://app.gladia.io/signin?redirect_to=https%3A%2F%2Fevil.example.com" | grep -o 'action="[^"]*"'` (already reflects)
impact: Open redirect / post-auth redirect to attacker site for credential capture or phishing; severity medium
testability: AUTH_HELPED
[HYP] npm `gladia` package impersonates official SDK from personal repo
class: OATH
asset: npm `gladia@0.1.3` (github.com/alexisbouchez/gladia.ts)
confidence: 55
reasoning: Passive `npm view` confirms `description` = "Official TypeScript SDK for Gladia" yet `repository.url` points to the personal account alexisbouchez/gladia.ts (not the official gladiaio org). Maintainer is `softwarecitadel <softwarecitadel@gmail.com>`. This is an ownership/typosquat anomaly that can mislead users into importing an unofficial package.
evidence_needed: npm registry metadata (description, repository.url, maintainer) mismatched against the official @gladiaio/sdk
verify_steps: passive PROBE: `npm view gladia@0.1.3 description repository.url maintainer homepage` (already run)
impact: Supply-chain confusion — developers install an unofficial/misattributed SDK thinking it is official; severity medium-high
testability: PASSIVE
[FINAL] (reranked, top first)
[NEXT] PROBE: `curl -H "Origin: https://evil.test" -D - -o /dev/null https://api.gladia.io/v1/models` — confirm the GET response also carries `access-control-allow-origin: *` (escalation check: can an attacker origin read the unauthenticated models payload, not just the preflight).
## 2026-08-07 19:22:20 UTC [app] (model laguna)
[PRIO] api.gladia.io, 9.1, attack_surface=10 business_value=9 tech_exposure=8 (Express/Mongo/S3/WSS) gate_ease=10 cloud_surface=9 freshness=10
[PRIO] app.gladia.io /signin, 6.5, attack_surface=6 business_value=8 tech_exposure=6 (OAuth2/React/HttpOnly cookies) gate_ease=6 cloud_surface=5 freshness=8
[PRIO] npm `gladia` 0.1.3 (registry), 5.5, attack_surface=4 business_value=5 tech_exposure=5 (supply-chain) gate_ease=9 cloud_surface=1 freshness=7
[HYP] IDOR on transcription file download endpoints /{id}/file
class: IDOR
asset: api.gladia.io /v2/transcription/{id}/file, /v2/pre-recorded/{id}/file, /v2/live/{id}/file
confidence: 50
reasoning: OpenAPI spec defines three GET {id}/file endpoints for downloading transcription audio/text files; authorization model (object-level access control) is opaque in the spec; endpoint names follow a pattern where {id} is a UUID — if the server does not bind the resource owner to the x-gladia-key scope, cross-account file access is possible. No spec property indicates per-resource ownership validation.
evidence_needed: Successful file download (200 with content) using a valid x-gladia-key belonging to a different user/session than the {id} target; error 403/404 when key does not match owner would disprove it.
verify_steps: AUTH_HELPED — obtain a trial/test API key from Gladia (authorized), POST /v2/transcription with a test audio_url, GET /v2/transcription/{other_user_id}/file with own key; observe 200 (IDOR) vs 403 (protected). Compare against /v2/pre-recorded/{id}/file and /v2/live/{id}/file.
impact: Unauthorized access to other users' transcription data (PII, audio, sensitive content); High
testability: AUTH_HELPED
[HYP] Post-OAuth redirect_to open redirect without host allowlist
class: OATH
asset: app.gladia.io /signin?redirect_to=
confidence: 48
reasoning: /signin reflects redirect_to URL-encoded into the OAuth form action server-side (verified passively: action="/signin?redirect_to=https%3A%2F%2Fevil.example.com"); return-to cookie confirmed as unsigned base64url JSON {"url":"/"} with no allowlist enforced on the cookie; Google-only OAuth flow; if redirect_to is honored post-auth without host validation, the signed-in user lands on attacker domain, enabling phishing or OAuth state theft. Return-to cookie tampering itself was rejected (server resets), but redirect_to is a separate parameter not tested interactively.
evidence_needed: After completing Google OAuth with ?redirect_to=https://evil.example.com, final HTTP 302 Location resolves to external host; redirect_to=//evil.example.com, ?redirect_to=evil.com variants also accepted.
verify_steps: AUTH_HELPED — complete Google OAuth sign-in (authorized/human session), GET /signin?redirect_to=https://evil.example.com, observe post-auth Location header; test protocol-relative and prefix-match variants
impact: Post-auth phishing redirect to attacker-controlled host; potential OAuth code/state interception if redirect_uri is also injectable; Medium
testability: AUTH_HELPED
[HYP] Tech stack disclosure via x-powered-by: Express on CORS preflight
class: MISCONFIG
asset: api.gladia.io (OPTIONS responses)
confidence: 90
reasoning: Confirmed via passive probe: OPTIONS preflight on /v2/pre-recorded returns `x-powered-by: Express`, revealing Node.js/Express.js; this header is absent from GET response headers but present on CORS preflight, enabling targeted framework-specific exploit scanning; combined with CORS wildcard and exposed trace headers, this lowers the bar for finding framework-level misconfigurations.
evidence_needed: `x-powered-by: Express` header in OPTIONS preflight response (observed); absent on GET responses (observed).
verify_steps: PROBE: `curl -sS -D - -o /dev/null -X OPTIONS -H "Origin: https://evil.test" -H "Access-Control-Request-Method: POST" -H "Access-Control-Request-Headers: x-gladia-key" https://api.gladia.io/v2/transcription`; `curl -sS -D - -o /dev/null https://api.gladia.io/v2/transcription` and compare headers for x-powered-by presence/absence
impact: Aids attacker reconnaissance (framework fingerprinting → known CVE targeting); Low
testability: PASSIVE
[PARKED] IDOR on transcription file download endpoints: confidence 50, AUTH_HELPED — cannot verify without valid API key; downgraded from 55 to 50 after confirming spec does not expose ownership-binding logic. Retained as actionable with key.
[PARKED] Post-OAuth redirect_to open redirect: confidence 48, AUTH_HELPED — return-to cookie REJECTED but redirect_to param is distinct; borderline on 40 threshold but retained due to distinct vector and prior laguna findings.
[FINAL] 1) Tech stack disclosure via x-powered-by: Express on CORS preflight (api.gladia.io, 90, MISCONFIG, PASSIVE)
[FINAL] 2) IDOR on transcription file download endpoints /{id}/file (api.gladia.io, 50, IDOR, AUTH_HELPED)
[FINAL] 3) Post-OAuth redirect_to open redirect without host allowlist (app.gladia.io /signin, 48, OATH, AUTH_HELPED)
[NEXT] PROBE: `curl -sS -D - -o /dev/null -X OPTIONS -H "Origin: https://evil.test" -H "Access-Control-Request-Method: POST" -H "Access-Control-Request-Headers: x-gladia-key" https://api.gladia.io/v2/transcription` then `curl -sS -D - -o /dev/null https://api.gladia.io/v2/transcription` — compare header sets to confirm `x-powered-by: Express` is present on preflight but absent on GET, and enumerate all framework/fingerprinting headers (e.g., `x-request-id`, `x-correlation-id`, `traceparent`).
[LEARN] ACCEPTED MISCONFIG @ api.gladia.io: `x-powered-by: Express` header present on CORS preflight (OPTIONS) responses only — confirms Node.js/Express.js backend; framework fingerprint for CVE targeting
[LEARN] REJECTED MISCONFIG @ api.gladia.io: /health?full=true does NOT leak verbose output — returns identical `{"health":"OK"}` to /health; no build/version/metadata disclosure via query params
[LEARN] REJECTED MISCONFIG @ api.gladia.io: /metrics endpoint does NOT exist — returns 404 (no Prometheus exposition endpoint)
[LEARN] REJECTED MISCONFIG @ api.gladia.io: /debug, /admin, /actuator/health, /v1 paths do NOT exist or return 404 — no Spring Boot Actuator, no debug panel, no catch-all admin
[LEARN] ACCEPTED MISCONFIG @ api.gladia.io: CORS preflight allows `Access-Control-Request-Headers: x-gladia-key` — auth header permitted in cross-origin requests (no credential support though)
[LEARN] ACCEPTED MISCONFIG @ api.gladia.io: /v2/live/init is NOT a real endpoint — confirmed 404 "Cannot POST"; WebSocket session is created via POST /v2/live, then client connects to returned `url` (wss://api.gladia.io/v2/live?token=<uuid>)
[RISK] api.gladia.io: 82 reason: Express/Node.js backend fingerprinted via x-powered-by on CORS preflight; full OpenAPI 3.1 spec (14 paths) publicly readable without auth; CORS wildcard with x-gladia-key permitted in cross-origin preflight but no credentials; /health endpoint undocumented and exposed with CORS *; WebSocket auth token in URL query param per spec (wss://api.gladia.io/v2/live?token=<uuid>); 401 error responses leak request_id + trace headers; all v2 endpoints uniformly key-gated (single security model, no MFA/scopes); SSTI/SSRF surface via audio_url/video_url (key-gated)
[RISK] app.gladia.io: 52 reason: Google-only OAuth limits auth bypass surface; /dashboard SPA shell served 200 without auth (client-side enforcement only); return-to cookie is unsigned base64url JSON (server resets on tampering, REJECTED open redirect); redirect_to param reflected in form action but post-auth behavior unverified without session; cookies correctly flagged HttpOnly/Secure/SameSite=Lax; HSTS preload in effect; /signin redirects 302 with noindex/nofollow
[RISK] sdk: 45 reason: Official @glidiaio/sdk 1.1.0 + gladiaio-sdk PyPI verified clean (reposcan: no secrets, no malicious code); npm `gladia` 0.1.3 ownership anomaly ACCEPTED (description claims "Official" but repo is personal alexisbouchez/gladia.ts, maintainer softwarecitadel@gmail.com, published before official package) — supply-chain impersonation risk remains; gladia-quiz-app loads @glidiaio/sdk@0.5.2 from unpkg CDN (version pinning on CDN)
